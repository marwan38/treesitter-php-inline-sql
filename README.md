# treesitter-php-inline-sql

This is influenced (copy pasted pretty much) from [TJ DeVries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3o9YaHBM4Q)

Tiny module to do inline SQL language stuff within a php file. Currently it
only looks for SQL heredocs.

Use at your own risk, pull requests are welcome.

## TODO

- [] Add sql formatting (?)
- [] Add sql linting (?)
